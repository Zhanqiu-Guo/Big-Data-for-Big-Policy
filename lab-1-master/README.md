# Lab Tutorial 1 - Getting Moving (To Opportunity)

In this lab tutorial, we will focus on learning the fundamentals of R using a subset of the "Moving to Opportunities" datset from the Opportunity Insights lab. We'll go over:

1. Language basics to help you speak like a programmer
2. Dataset basics: what is a dataset? how do I use one in R?  
  `read.csv()`  
3. How to view and summarize your data using commands such as:  
  `head()`  
  `tail()`  
  `mean()`  
  `table()`  
  `cor.test()`  
4. How to merge datasets  
  `merge()`  

Before getting started with [lab 1](lab-1.md), review the R Installation document (R Installation.docx) to set up R Studio on your machine.
